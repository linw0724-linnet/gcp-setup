# Introduction
> [!NOTE]
> This instruction set assumes that you have already successfully completed a clean install of Ubuntu Server on your VM on GCP.

This instruction set will install Snipe-It inside a Docker container on your VM on GCP.

This installation of Snipe-It will utilize a Bucket on GCP to store image/file uploads and utilize Mailgun for e-mail functions.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently figuring out how to incorporate an externally run mySQL instance on GCP with the Docker instance. This will allow the storage drive capacity of the VM to stay the same and the mySQL instance has the feature to automatically increase the database storage size (this will minimize maintenance as the database size increases).
